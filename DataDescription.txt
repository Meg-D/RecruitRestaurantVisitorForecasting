Data Description
In this competition, you are provided a time-series forecasting problem centered around restaurant visitors. The data comes from two separate sites:

Hot Pepper Gourmet (hpg) : similar to Yelp, here users can search restaurants and also make a reservation online
AirREGI / Restaurant Board (air) : similar to Square, a reservation control and cash register system
You must use the reservations, visits, and other information from these sites to forecast future restaurant visitor totals on a given date. The training data covers the dates from 2016 until early (first week) April 2017. The test set covers the mid weeks (second and third weeks) of April 2017. The training and testing set both omit days where the restaurants were closed.

File Descriptions
This is a relational dataset from two systems. Each file is prefaced with the source (either air_ or hpg_) to indicate its origin. Each restaurant has a unique air_store_id and hpg_store_id. Note that not all restaurants are covered by both systems, and that you have been provided data beyond the restaurants for which you must forecast. Latitudes and Longitudes are not exact to discourage de-identification of restaurants.
